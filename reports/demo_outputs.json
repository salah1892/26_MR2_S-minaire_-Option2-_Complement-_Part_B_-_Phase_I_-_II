The system must: - Use foundation models (LLMs and, later, multimodal models) combined with RetrievalAugmented Generation (RAG).- Be orchestrated using a workflow tool (e.g. n8nstyle logic: triggers, nodes, branches, subworkflows).- Respect AI sovereignty constraints (preference for openweight models, local/vectorized storage of Tunisian data, minimal reliance on foreign services for sensitive data).- Exhibit agentic behavior (the assistant decides when to search, translate, consult an ontology, or refuse).The exam is split into two phases:Phase 1 – Inclass Design (No Internet)",

You must implement and evaluate the design from Phase 1, with minimal justified adaptations.4. Implementation and demonstrationUsing a workflow/orchestration tool of your choice (e.g. n8nstyle system):- Implement the ingestion/indexing workflow and the query/agent workflow that correspond to your Phase1 diagrams (adaptations must be explained briefly). - Provide evidence of execution (screenshots of workflows, log excerpts, and at least 3 example queries and outputs that show: - a purely heritage RAG answer, - a case requiring translation, - a case that should be refused or redirected).Your implementation can be minimal but must be coherent with your initial design. 5. Evaluation and critical reflectionPrepare a concise report (1–2 pages) that includes: 5.1 Test and evaluation results - At least 5 test queries (including some from Phase 1) that cover: - Different languages (Arabic/French). - Different content types (poetry, rituals, historical events). - At least one “difficult” or ambiguous",
